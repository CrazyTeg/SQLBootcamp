-- 00 Let�s expand our data model to involve a new business feature.
-- Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for clients.
-- Please think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizzeria restaurants from other.
-- Need to create a new relational table (please set a name person_discounts) with the next rules.

-- set id attribute like a Primary Key (please take a look on id column in existing tables and choose the same data type)
-- set for attributes person_id and pizzeria_id foreign keys for corresponding tables (data types should be the same like for id columns in corresponding parent tables)
-- please set explicit names for foreign keys constraints by pattern fk_{table_name}_{column_name},  for example fk_person_discounts_person_id

-- add a discount attribute to store a value of discount in percent. Remember, discount value can be a number with floats
-- (please just use numeric data type). So, please choose the corresponding data type to cover this possibility.

create table person_discounts(id bigint primary key,
							 person_id bigint not null,
							 pizzeria_id bigint not null,
							 discount numeric not null,
							 constraint fk_person_visits_person_id foreign key (person_id) references person(id),
							 constraint fk_person_visits_pizzeria_id foreign key (pizzeria_id) references pizzeria(id)
							 );
